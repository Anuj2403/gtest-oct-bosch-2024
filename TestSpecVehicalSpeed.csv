Test Case Name,Description,Input/Precondition,Expected Output
BNFSpeedSensorTest.SpeedInRange,Verifies that the speed sensor returns a value within the valid range of 1 to 100.,Instantiate a BNFSpeedSensor object.,The returned speed value is between 1 and 100.
IOTCloudCommunicatorTest.SuccessfulPush,Ensures that the cloud communicator returns a successful status code (200-399) when sending a message.,Call the pushMessage function with a test message.,A status code between 200 and 399 is returned.
IOTCloudCommunicatorTest.FailedPush,Verifies that the cloud communicator returns a failure status code (400-500) when sending a message.,Call the pushMessage function with a test message.,A status code between 400 and 500 is returned.
SpeedMonitorTest.InvalidThreshold,Checks if an error message is displayed when the speed threshold is invalid (0 or 101).,Instantiate a SpeedMonitor object with an invalid threshold.,An error message is printed to the console.
SpeedMonitorTest.BelowThreshold,Verifies that no message is sent to the cloud communicator when the current speed is below the threshold.,Instantiate a SpeedMonitor object with a high threshold.,No calls to pushMessage.
SpeedMonitorTest.AboveThresholdSuccess,Ensures that a message is sent to the cloud communicator when the current speed exceeds the threshold and the communication is successful.,"Instantiate a SpeedMonitor object with a low threshold.",A message is sent to the cloud communicator.
SpeedMonitorTest.AboveThresholdFailure,Verifies that an error message is logged when the current speed exceeds the threshold but the cloud communication fails.,"Instantiate a SpeedMonitor object with a low threshold, mock the speed sensor to return a high speed value.",An error message is logged.
